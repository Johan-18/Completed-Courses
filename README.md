These are a couple links for some sample projects I created with tutorials!

# MERN E-COMMERCE

ProShop - A simple E-commerce web app that has admin functionalities such as: editing/removing/adding users; editing/removing/adding products; marking orders as delivered.
ADMIN - { email: "admin@example.com", password: "0123456" }
DISCLOSER - The paypal functions work properly and I have the account in sandbox mode; However, with that said do not buy anything if thats even possible as I am not actually selling those products.
